I am a software developer, specializing in the [Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)](https://www.adobe.com/marketing/experience-manager.html) content management system since about 2009.

My current profile image is a photograph of the painting [Portrait of a Man, traditionally known as *Gozen Centen*](https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/portret-van-een-man-bekend-als-gozen-centen-1611-12-77/KQEjYlmp24UkNQ) by [Govert Flinck](https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/govert-flinck/m01sw13?categoryid=artist), which was [identified as my "lookalike"](https://www.bustle.com/p/how-to-find-your-painting-lookalike-with-the-google-arts-culture-app-aka-everyones-newest-obsession-7908433) by the [Google Arts & Culture](https://artsandculture.google.com/) app.
